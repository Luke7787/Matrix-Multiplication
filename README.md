This lab examines the performance enhancements achieved by parallelizing matrix multiplication using two strategies: Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD) and Multithreading with OpenMP. The experiments were conducted using ARMv8-A assembly language, demonstrating the efficiency of SIMD for simultaneous operations and OpenMP for leveraging multiple CPU threads. The focus was on the impact of these parallelization techniques on computation speed in matrix multiplication.
